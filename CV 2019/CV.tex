\section{\textcolor{BrickRed}{Dir}ection}
My Research Interests include Mathematical Logic, Algorithms, Complexity theory, Quantum Computing and Artificial Intelligence. I like combining research with innovation to help solve challenging problems.\\
As Prof. Richard Feynman put it beautifully, "The \emph{worthwhile} problems are the ones you can really solve or help solve, the ones you can really contribute something to."
